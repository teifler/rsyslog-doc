**Action specific Configuration Directives:**

-  Pipe: string a fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination for log messages. 

**Caveats/Known Bugs:**
None

**Sample:**
The following command sends all syslog messages to a remote server via TCP port 10514.

::

        Module (path="builtin:ompipe") 
        *.* action(type="ompipe"
        Pipe="NameofPipe")
    
**Legacy Configuration Directives:**

rsyslog has support for logging output to named pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination for log messages by prepending a pipe symbol ("|") to the name of the file. This is handy for debugging. Note that the fifo must be created with the mkfifo(1) command before rsyslogd is started. 

**Legacy Sample:**

The following command sends all syslog messages to a remote server via TCP port 10514.
